## MSc Data Science 2015/16
**Description**

*Code examples and reports from data science masters at City University, London*

###Motivation and purpose

Some code and exampoles of work produced during the course of my Data Science Masters at City University. Intended to be both a showcase and useful 
to anyone interested in data science.

####Content

So far I have added some code from our Principles of Data Science class, which involved doing some data mashups and then using
that data for analysis. Also the reports explaining analysis strategy and methods are included. This is done in Python. 
There are two analysis projects for this course.
