## MSc Data Science 2015/16
**Description**

*Code examples and reports from data science masters at City University, London*

###Motivation and purpose

Some code and exampoles of work produced during the course of my Data Science Masters at City University. Intended to be both a showcase and useful 
to anyone interested in data science.

###Content

####Principles of Data Science

So far I have added some code from our Principles of Data Science class, which involved doing some data mashups and then using
that data for analysis. Also the reports explaining analysis strategy and methods are included. This is done in Python. 
There are two analysis projects for this course. 

This is organised as follows:
+ Project 1: corresponds to DataScienceReport and report1_analysis.py
+ Project 2: corresponds to DataScience_Coursework2_report and f1 to f4 .py files
+ Jupyter Notebooks of some adhoc analysis such as clustering, network analysis and dimensionality reduction

####Machine Learning

For this course we tested two machine learning models against a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis
was conducted in Matlab and we produced a poster.

Machine Learning Projects:
+ Matlab code and A1 poster presenting results and finidngs

####Neural Networks

This is building on the introductory Machine Learning material and exploring Neural Networks in detail.

Neural Network Projects:
+ Compare a Multi Layer Perceptron and SVM for classification and suggested a new approach to evaluation of such models
+ Python code and report

####Software Agents

Experimenting with deterministic and stochastic versions of the Q Learning algorithm with different parameterisations.

Contains:
+ Deterministic Q learning notebook
+ Stochastic Q Learning notebook
+ Report analysing results and making some new contributions
