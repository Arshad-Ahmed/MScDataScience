Dynamic Network Analysis of Enron Email Data,
,
Test Number,Description
00,First look at data and initial checks
01,Break into networks but with cumulative yearly aggregation and look at centrality and other network statistics
02,Break data into monthly and yearly aggregations without cumulative aggregation and choose benchmark measures. Derive Seismic attributes from Laplacian matrix to evaluate their plausibility
03,Deriving Seismic attributes from 3 graph matrices
04,Comparison of attributes from 3 graph matrices to benchmark measures
05,Consolidate analysis and remove analysis that 
06,Derivation of Music attributes as a proof of concept and consolidated analysis for report.
06.1,Derivation of Seismic and Music attributes from 3 graph matrices
06.2,Comparison of all attributes from the 3 graph matrices using SNR and Entropy
