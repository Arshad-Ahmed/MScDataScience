The raw Enron corpus contains 619,446 messages belonging to 158 users. We cleaned the corpus before this analysis by removing certain folders from each user, such as discussionthreads. These folders were present for most users, and did not appear to be used directly by the users, but rather were computer generated. Many, such as alldocuments, also contained large numbers of duplicate emails, which were already present in the users other folders. Our goal in this paper is to analyze the suitability of this corpus for exploring how to classify messages as organized by a human, so these folders would have likely been misleading.},

abstract = {The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis, and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A large body of work has been devoted to defining and identifying clusters or communities in social and information networks. We explore from a novel perspective several questions related to identifying meaningful communities in large social and information networks, and we come to several striking conclusions. We employ approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning problem to characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural properties of partitions of graphs that could plausibly be interpreted as communities. In particular, we define the network community profile plot, which characterizes the "best" possible community--according to the conductance measure--over a wide range of size scales. We study over 100 large real-world social and information networks. Our results suggest a significantly more refined picture of community structure in large networks than has been appreciated previously. In particular, we observe tight communities that are barely connected to the rest of the network at very small size scales; and communities of larger size scales gradually "blend into" the expander-like core of the network and thus become less "community-like." This behavior is not explained, even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network generation models. Moreover, it is exactly the opposite of what one would expect based on intuition from expander graphs, low-dimensional or manifold-like graphs, and from small social networks that have served as testbeds of community detection algorithms. We have found that a generative graph model, in which new edges are added via an iterative "forest fire" burning process, is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network community profile plot similar to what we observe in our network datasets.},

The graph theoretical analysis includes the computation of several graph metrics such as degree distribution, average distance ratio, clustering coefficient and compactness over the email graph. The spectral analysis shows that the email adjacency matrix has a rank-2 approximation. It is shown that preprocessing of data has significant impact on the results, thus a standard form is needed for establishing a benchmark data.},

In this paper we consider extended similarity metrics for documents and other objects embedded in graphs, facilitated via a lazy graph walk. We provide a detailed instantiation of this framework for email data, where content, social networks and a timeline are integrated in a structural graph. The suggested framework is evaluated for two email-related problems: disambiguating names in email documents, and threading. We show that reranking schemes based on the graph-walk similarity measures often outperform baseline methods, and that further improvements can be obtained by use of appropriate learning methods.},

We use random networks of varying sizes and densities and subject them (separately) to four kinds of random error in varying amounts. The types of error are edge deletion, node deletion, edge addition, and node addition. The results show that the accuracy of centrality measures declines smoothly and predictably with the amount of error. This suggests that, for random networks and random error, we shall be able to construct confidence intervals around centrality scores. In addition, centrality measures were highly similar in their response to error. Dense networks were the most robust in the face of all kinds of error except edge deletion.

abstract = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the "wrong" answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Wei2015,
abstract = {Given social networks over time, how can we measure network activities across different timesteps with a limited number of metrics? We propose two classes of dynamic metrics for assessing temporal evolution patterns of agents in terms of persistency and emergence. For each class of dynamic metrics, we implement it using three different temporal aggregation models ranging from the most commonly used Average Aggregation Model to more the complex models such as the Exponential Aggregation Model. We argue that the problem of measuring temporal patterns can be formulated using Recency and Primacy effect, which is a concept used to characterize human cognitive processes. Experimental results show that the way metrics model Recency-Primacy effect is closely related to their abilities to measure temporal patterns. Furthermore, our results indicate that future network agent activities can be predicted based on history information using dynamic metrics. By conducting multiple experiments, we are also able to find an optimal length of history information that is most relevant to future activities. This optimal length is highly consistent within a dataset and can be used as an intrinsic metric to evaluate a dynamic social network.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In social settings, individuals interact through webs of relationships. Each individual is a node in a complex network (or graph) of interdependencies and generates data, lots of data. We label the data by its source, or formally stated, we index the data by the nodes of the graph. The resulting signals (data indexed by the nodes) are far removed from time or image signals indexed by well ordered time samples or pixels. DSP, discrete signal processing, provides a comprehensive, elegant, and efficient methodology to describe, represent, transform, analyze, process, or synthesize these well ordered time or image signals. This paper extends to signals on graphs DSP and its basic tenets, including filters, convolution, z-transform, impulse response, spectral representation, Fourier transform, frequency response, and illustrates DSP on graphs by classifying blogs, linear predicting and compressing data from irregularly located weather stations, or predicting behavior of customers of a mobile service provider.},

abstract = {We propose a novel discrete signal processing framework for structured datasets that arise from social, economic, biological, and physical networks. Our framework extends traditional discrete signal processing theory to datasets with complex structure that can be represented by graphs, so that data elements are indexed by graph nodes and relations between elements are represented by weighted graph edges. We interpret such datasets as signals on graphs, introduce the concept of graph filters for processing such signals, and discuss important properties of graph filters, including linearity, shift-invariance, and invertibility. We then demonstrate the application of graph filters to data classification by demonstrating that a classifier can be interpreted as an adaptive graph filter. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high classification accuracy.},

@article{Anderson1985,
abstract = {The difficulties are almost always at the boundary. That statement applies to the solution of partial differential equations (with a given boundary) and also to shape optimization (with an unknown boundary). These problems require two decisions, closely related but not identical:1. How to discretize the boundary conditions.2. How to discretize the boundary itself.That second problem is the one we discuss here. The region $\Omega$ is frequently replaced by a polygon or polyhedron. The approximate boundary ϖ$\Omega$N may be only a linear interpolation of the true boundary ϖ$\Omega$.Q. A perturbation theory that applies to smooth changes of domain is often less successful for a polygon. This paper concentrates on a model problem-the simplest we could findand we look at eigenvalues of the Laplacian.The boundary ϖ$\Omega$ will be the unit circle. The approximate boundary ϖ$\Omega$N is the regular inscribed polygon with N equal sides. It seems impossible that the eigenvalues of regular polygons have not been intensively studied., but we have not yet located an authoritative reference. The problem will be approached numerically from three directions, without attempting a general theory. Those directions are:1. Finite-element discretizations of the polygons $\Omega$N.2. A Taylor series based on piecewise smooth perturbations of the circle.3. A series expansion of the eigenvalues in powers of 1/N.The second author particularly wishes that we could have consulted George Fix about this problem.His Harvard thesis demonstrated the tremendous improvement that singular elements can bring to the finite-element method (particularly when $\Omega$ has a reentrant corner, or even a crack). His numerical experiments in 1 came at the beginning of a long and successful career in applied mathematics. We only wish it had been longer.},

abstract = {An analysis is conducted on the robustness of measures of centrality in the face of random error in the network data. We use random networks of varying sizes and densities and subject them (separately) to four kinds of random error in varying amounts. The types of error are edge deletion, node deletion, edge addition, and node addition. The results show that the accuracy of centrality measures declines smoothly and predictably with the amount of error. This suggests that, for random networks and random error, we shall be able to construct confidence intervals around centrality scores. In addition, centrality measures were highly similar in their response to error. Dense networks were the most robust in the face of all kinds of error except edge deletion. For edge deletion, sparse networks were more accurately measured. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Borgatti2006a,
abstract = {The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis, and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In many applications, for example, in pattern recognition and computer vision, it is required to measure the similarity of objects. When graphs are used for the representation of structured objects, then the problem of measuring object similarity turns into the problem of computing the similarity of graphs, which is also known as graph matching. In this paper, similarity measures on graphs and related algorithms are reviewed. Also theoretical work showing various relations between different similarity measures is discussed. Other topics to be addressed include graph clustering and efficient indexing of large databases of graphs},

abstract = {As a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, graph matching has applications in a variety of fields, from computer vision to computational biology. In graph matching, patterns are modeled as graphs and pattern recognition amounts to finding a correspondence between the nodes of different graphs. Many formulations of this problem can be cast in general as a quadratic assignment problem, where a linear term in the objective function encodes node compatibility and a quadratic term encodes edge compatibility. The main research focus in this theme is about designing efficient algorithms for approximately solving the quadratic assignment problem, since it is NP-hard. In this paper we turn our attention to a different question: how to estimate compatibility functions such that the solution of the resulting graph matching problem best matches the expected solution that a human would manually provide. We present a method for learning graph matching: the training examples are pairs of graphs and the `labels' are matches between them. Our experimental results reveal that learning can substantially improve the performance of standard graph matching algorithms. In particular, we find that simple linear assignment with such a learning scheme outperforms Graduated Assignment with bistochastic normalisation, a state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation algorithm.},

Based on this analysis, we derive a ranking scheme for spectral matchings based on their reliability, and propose a novel iterative probabilistic matching algorithm that relaxes some of the implicit assumptions used in prior works.

It is an extension to previously developed measure of similarity (Komosinski et al., Theor Biosci 2001, 120, 271-286) that was only able to consider the structure of 3D constructs. Morphologies are modeled as graphs with vertices as points in a 3D space, and edges connecting these vertices. This model is very general, therefore the proposed algorithm can be applied in (and across) a number of disciplines including artificial life, evolutionary design, engineering, robotics, biology, and chemistry. The primary areas of application of this fast numerical similarity measure are artificial life and evolutionary design, where great numbers of morphologies result from simulated evolutionary processes, and both structural and geometric aspects are significant. Geometry of 3D constructs (i.e., locations of body parts in space) is as important as the structure (i.e., connections of body parts), because both determine behavior of creatures or designs and their fitness in a particular environment. In this work, both morphological aspects are incorporated in a single, highly discriminative measure of similarity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of finding a matching between two sets of features, given complex relations among them, going beyond pairwise. Each feature set is modeled by a hypergraph where the complex relations are represented by hyper-edges. A match between the feature sets is then modeled as a hypergraph matching problem. We derive the hyper-graph matching problem in a probabilistic setting represented by a convex optimization. First, we formalize a soft matching criterion that emerges from a probabilistic interpretation of the problem input and output, as opposed to previous methods that treat soft matching as a mere relaxation of the hard matching problem. Second, the model induces an algebraic relation between the hyper-edge weight matrix and the desired vertex-to-vertex probabilistic matching. Third, the model explains some of the graph matching normalization proposed in the past on a heuristic basis such as doubly stochastic normalizations of the edge weights. A key benefit of the model is that the global optimum of the matching criteria can be found via an iterative successive projection algorithm. The algorithm reduces to the well known Sinkhorn [15] row/column matrix normalization procedure in the special case when the two graphs have the same number of vertices and a complete matching is desired. Another benefit of our model is the straight-forward scalability from graphs to hyper-graphs.},

Each feature set is modeled by a hypergraph where the complex relations are represented by hyper-edges. A match between the feature sets is then modeled as a hypergraph matching problem. We derive the hyper-graph matching problem in a probabilistic setting represented by a convex optimization. First, we formalize a soft matching criterion that emerges from a probabilistic interpretation of the problem input and output, as opposed to previous methods that treat soft matching as a mere relaxation of the hard matching problem. Second, the model induces an algebraic relation between the hyper-edge weight matrix and the desired vertex-to-vertex probabilistic matching. Third, the model explains some of the graph matching normalization proposed in the past on a heuristic basis such as doubly stochastic normalizations of the edge weights. A key benefit of the model is that the global optimum of the matching criteria can be found via an iterative successive projection algorithm. The algorithm reduces to the well known Sinkhorn [15] row/column matrix normalization procedure in the special case when the two graphs have the same number of vertices and a complete matching is desired. Another benefit of our model is the straight-forward scalability from graphs to hyper-graphs.},

abstract = {The difficulties are almost always at the boundary. That statement applies to the solution of partial differential equations (with a given boundary) and also to shape optimization (with an unknown boundary). These problems require two decisions, closely related but not identical:1. How to discretize the boundary conditions.2. How to discretize the boundary itself.That second problem is the one we discuss here. The region $\Omega$ is frequently replaced by a polygon or polyhedron. The approximate boundary ϖ$\Omega$N may be only a linear interpolation of the true boundary ϖ$\Omega$.Q. A perturbation theory that applies to smooth changes of domain is often less successful for a polygon. This paper concentrates on a model problem-the simplest we could findand we look at eigenvalues of the Laplacian.The boundary ϖ$\Omega$ will be the unit circle. The approximate boundary ϖ$\Omega$N is the regular inscribed polygon with N equal sides. It seems impossible that the eigenvalues of regular polygons have not been intensively studied., but we have not yet located an authoritative reference. The problem will be approached numerically from three directions, without attempting a general theory. Those directions are:1. Finite-element discretizations of the polygons $\Omega$N.2. A Taylor series based on piecewise smooth perturbations of the circle.3. A series expansion of the eigenvalues in powers of 1/N.The second author particularly wishes that we could have consulted George Fix about this problem.His Harvard thesis demonstrated the tremendous improvement that singular elements can bring to the finite-element method (particularly when $\Omega$ has a reentrant corner, or even a crack). His numerical experiments in 1 came at the beginning of a long and successful career in applied mathematics. We only wish it had been longer.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Drawing Fig. 1. Techniques designed to reduce edge clutter (left) and example of confluent drawing for a directed network (right). Abstract— In this paper, we investigate Confluent Drawings (CD), a technique for bundling edges in node-link diagrams based on network connectivity. Edge-bundling techniques are designed to reduce edge clutter in node-link diagrams by coalescing lines into common paths or bundles. Unfortunately, traditional bundling techniques introduce ambiguity since edges are only bundled by spatial proximity, rather than network connectivity; following an edge from its source to its target can lead to the perception of incorrect connectivity if edges are not clearly separated within the bundles. Contrary, CDs bundle edges based on common sources or targets. Thus, a smooth path along a confluent bundle indicates precise connectivity. While CDs have been described in theory, practical investigation and application to real-world networks (i.e., networks beyond those with certain planarity restrictions) is currently lacking. Here, we provide the first algorithm for constructing CDs from arbitrary directed and undirected networks and present a simple layout method, embedded in a sand box environment providing techniques for interactive exploration. We then investigate patterns and artifacts in CDs, which we compare to other common edge-bundling techniques. Finally, we present the first user study that compares edge-compression techniques, including CD, power graphs, metro-style, and common edge bundling. We found that users without particular expertise in visualization or network analysis are able to read small CDs without difficulty. Compared to existing bundling techniques, CDs are more likely to allow people to correctly perceive connectivity.},

abstract = {— In this work we address the problem of retrieving potentially interesting matrix views to support the exploration of networks. We introduce Matrix Diagnostics (or MAGNOSTICS), following in spirit related approaches for rating and ranking other visualization techniques, such as Scagnostics for scatter plots. Our approach ranks matrix views according to the appearance of specific visual patterns, such as blocks and lines, indicating the existence of topological motifs in the data, such as clusters, bi-graphs, or central nodes. MAGNOSTICS can be used to analyze, query, or search for visually similar matrices in large collections, or to assess the quality of matrix reordering algorithms. While many feature descriptors for image analyzes exist, there is no evidence how they perform for detecting patterns in matrices. In order to make an informed choice of feature descriptors for matrix diagnostics, we evaluate 30 feature descriptors—27 existing ones and three new descriptors that we designed specifically for MAGNOSTICS—with respect to four criteria: pattern response, pattern variability, pattern sensibility, and pattern discrimination. We conclude with an informed set of six descriptors as most appropriate for MAGNOSTICS and demonstrate their application in two scenarios; exploring a large collection of matrices and analyzing temporal networks.},

abstract = {—This paper presents a method, based on the Smirnov transform, for generating synthetic data with the statistical properties of L{\'{e}}vy-walks. This method for synthetic data generation can be utilized for generating arbitrary prescribed probability density functions (pdf). The Smirnov transform is used to solve a cybersecurity engineering problem associated with Internet traffic. The synthetic L{\'{e}}vy-walk process is intertwined with sections of other distinct characteristics (uniform noise, Gaussian noise, and an ordinary sinusoid) to create a composite signal, which is then analyzed with zero-crossing rate (ZCR) within a varying-size window. This paper shows that it is possible to identify the distinct sections present in the composite signal through ZCR. The differentiation of these sections shows an increasing ZCR value as the section under analysis exhibits a higher activity or complexity (from the sinusoid, to a synthetic L{\'{e}}vy-walk process, and uniform and Gaussian noise, respectively). The advantages of the ZCR computation directly in the time-domain are appealing for real-time implementations. The varying window in the ZCR produces more defined values as the window size increases.},

The stimuli were 16 music instrument tones, 8 of which were modified in pairs. This modification consisted of exchanging the shape of the spectral energy distribution between the two tones within each pair. The three-dimensional spatial representation of similarities among the 16 tones was obtained by multidimensional scaling techniques and compared to a previous scaling of the original 16 unmodified tones J. M. Grey, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 61, 1270-1277 (1977). The pairs of tones which had exchanged spectral shapes in fact exchanged orders on the spatial axis which had been previously interpreted as relating to spectral shape, thereby supporting the earlier interpretation. The two remaining axes of the spatial solution also retained their original interpretations, relating to various temporal details of the tones. A set of formal quantitative models for the spectral dimension was constructed and tested, and the results further supported the interpretation of this perceptual axis.},

We propose a probabilistic graphical model, Time-evolving Influence Model (TIM), to capture the temporal dynamics of graphs, in which the time-evolving influence is hidden, and to leverage the information from heterogeneous graphs, with which we can improve the learned knowledge. To learn the graphical model, we design both non-parallel and parallel Gibbs sampling algorithms.
